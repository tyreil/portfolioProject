# Portfolio Project 

Project Requirements: 

1. Find three (3) designers and their portfolio sites. Use their portfolio sites as a source of inspiration for yours. 

2. Create a Content Priority Guide (Links to an external site.) for your portfolio site. You will need a minimum of 3 portfolio pieces. If you do not have 3 portfolio pieces, contact me. 

3. Create 8-10 wireframe layouts, ultimately choosing one to use as the structure for your UI. You will need to annotate the chosen wireframe with notes on how you plan on structuring your HTML.  

4. Create a style tile (Links to an external site.) that establishes the visual direction of your UI. 

5. Create a mobile and desktop design in Photoshop using a grid. 

6. Create a Github Repo titled "portfolio", and build your designs using HTML/CSS. I should be able to find your portfolio by going to YOURUSERNAME.github.io/portfolio. Your site should be built mobile first, then using media queries to then lay out your desktop layout.
